                    The Lightning Enterprises WebServer was no easy feat to accomplish. Our team at Sworadix LLC as well as the 
                    companies that helped guide our efforts towards our goals, went on to work tirelessly for 4 years in order 
                    to bring the products and services we have to offer you today.
                    
                    Often we are asked by our peers what makes our cloud hosting enterprise server more secure than others on the market, 
                    our answer is discretion and divergence. Our business model is around a very tight circle which encompasses a range 
                    of protocols that are managed by a distributed force we feel is mature enough and experienced enough to maintain proper
                    anonymity as well as power of retrievable assets. 
                    
                    We know that data of any sort could harm potential sectors of a corporate environment in multifaceted fashion, that is why we are concerned over the protection of every bit
                    of information that goes in and out of our system of operations; no pun intended.

                    These specifications of security measures are carried out by our artificially intelligent performer using developer tools built by our engineers here at Sworadix LLC. These tools and the downloadable software to use these tools may be found on our website under the <a href="dashboard.html"><u>Dashboard</u></a> tag.
                    We manage the data of some of the largest enterprise firms in the world, our networking must remain as stable and reliable as possible. This is why we hard wire each of our servers as well as abiding by the OSHA Cable-Management-Policy guidelines.

                    File uploads are a hazard from all ports, that is why our server filters upload traffic from files that need to reach external flight.

                    Sometimes the best part about you is the part you never thought you'd get to know, well for us at Sworadix that best part is cloud hosting and web server configuration! When we first entered the cybersecurity industry in late 2017 we expected to hear a lot
                    from investors about the quantum winter we were all to inherit and "weather", it has since come to surface that web hosting and web server management is inefficient enough to pose no threat to consumer data, infact your data is barely recognizale just after a single transaction.
                    That is why we stress to our clients that power, organization and management of those two are far more valuable to the sensitive data our customers interact with on a daily basis than any other combinatino of efforts.
